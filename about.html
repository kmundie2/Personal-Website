        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Embarking on my career journey, I began as a Cross Dock Supervisor at XPO, where I cultivated essential skills in logistics and operations management. Over time, my passion for ensuring quality and efficiency led me to transition into a new role as a Quality Assurance Analyst at Universal Logistics. In this capacity, I've found my niche, utilizing my attention to detail and analytical mindset to meticulously assess processes and procedures, identify areas for improvement, and implement solutions to enhance overall performance. Whether conducting thorough inspections, analyzing data to pinpoint trends, or collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive continuous improvement initiatives, I am dedicated to upholding the highest standards of quality and reliability. Each day presents new challenges and opportunities for growth, and I am grateful for the chance to make a meaningful impact in the dynamic and fast-paced world of logistics.
